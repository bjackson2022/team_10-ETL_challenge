## team_10-ETL_challenge
This project was conducted during a data analytics bootcamp through the Georgia Institute of Technology. This project specifically focuses on the ETL database management process. 

#Theme of the Project

Data Purpose: We are combining the IMDB and movie streaming platform datasets to determine the overall popularity by rating and availability across multiple platforms.
(final display attributes- genre, IMDB rating, content rating, gross profit, budget, actor_1_name, year)
Extract: We are using two .csv data sets downloaded from Kaggle.com
Transform: The two datasets will be joined on the name of the movie. The transformations we would perform on these would be data cleaning, filtering and joining. This will be done with Python and Pandas. 
Load: The combined dataset will be loaded into a final relational database and we will use Postgres.

Lists of datasets that we intend to use: 
Movies on Netflix, Prime, Hulu & Disney-
